Change the headers on a CSV file based on a specified mapping.

Call csv-remap with -h for help.

Requires python and the openpyxl package if using XLSX files.


The first argument is expected to be a file which defines the old name and new
name for the column headers, as either a CSV or XLSX file:

old,new
Foo Indication,foo_indicator
Bar Code,bar

After that, it takes 0 or more arguments of files to process. If not files or -
is given, standard in is read.

Examples:

cat /tmp/some_junk.csv | csv-remap /tmp/mapping.csv > /tmp/all_better.csv
csv-remap /tmp/mapping.csv /tmp/some_junk.csv > /tmp/all_better.csv
